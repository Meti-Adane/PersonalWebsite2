                <date class="date-text">Feb 20 2020</date>
                <br><br>
                The Internet is a worldwide system of interconnected computer networks that use the <a class="text-primary" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=TCP-IP&redirect=no" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TCP/IP</a> set of network protocols to reach billions of users. The Internet began as a U.S Department of Defense network to link scientists and university professors around the world.
                <br><br>
                The history / development of the internet began in the early 1960’s. Initially, the internet was a US defense department project that was born out of the Cold War and a desire to have armed forces communicate over a connected, distributed network. 
                <br><br>
                The first workable prototype of the Internet came in the late 1960s with the creation of <a class="text-primary" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ARPANET</a>, which was originally funded by the U.S. Department of Defense, ARPANET used packet switching to allow multiple computers to communicate on a single network.
                <br><br>
                On October 29, 1969, ARPANET delivered its first message, a “node-to-node” communication from one computer which was located in a research lab at UCLA to another computer which was located at Stanford) The message “LOGIN” was short and simple, but it crashed and the Stanford computer only received the note’s first two letters, “Lo”. Hence, “LO” was the very first internet message to ever be sent. The technology continued to grow in the 1970s after scientists Robert Kahn and Vinton Cerf developed Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol, or TCP/IP, a communications model that set standards for how data could be transmitted between multiple networks. 
                <br><br>
                Back in1969 there were only 4 nodes connected to the internet as shown in picture below. 
                <br><br> 
                <img class="img-fluid m-auto" src="https://www.computerhope.com/cdn/1969-internet.gif"> 
                <br>
                
                Few decades later, in 1983 5 cities namely UCLA, Stanford, UC Santa Barbara, the university of Utah and BBN had been connected. The US military was given its own branch of ARPANET, called MILNET, for secure communications, allowing other research and communication to take place on ARPANET.
                <br><br>
                The “internet”, which was previously called APRANET, officially got its name in 1984 when it had connected 1000 hosts at different university and corporate labs. The internet domain name system was also created in 1984 to match complex IP addresses with easy to remember names ending in extensions as com, Edu, gov, mil, and org. Today the internet links more than 440 million computers directly and millions more have internet access through private addressing schemes. This was due to the many technological advancements that were made throughout the years closing the gap between the internet’s reachability and the users.
                <br><br>
                Throughout the years the internet had not only changed its name but the number of connections had also tremendously increased from the initial 4 nodes to billions of computers connected.
