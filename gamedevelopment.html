                <br>
    <p class="mt-5">
    As the current trend is basically of an interactive nature, gaming too has adopted the same and has paved the way for three dimensional games take over the mobile and the computer platforms. The popularity of the game largely depends on the perspective the user has towards the game. So, the entire effort is towards developing games that will keep the players enticed for a long time.
    <br>
    <h2 class="text-uppercase font-weight-bolder my-3">Unity</h2>
    Unity is a completely integrated development framework provides rich solutions that give out-of-the-box functionality and help in creating games. The intuitive workspace, the complete toolset and productive and rapid workflows that come in Unity framework enable the users to reduce the effort, time and cost drastically in making such kind of interactive content.
    <br><br>
    One of the best features this tool provides is its cross platform integration, which allows game developers to switch any game platform between Android, Blackberry, iOS and Windows as well. Notably, the cross platform integration of the Unity supports as many as 25 platforms.
    <br><br>
    It also has the capability to support a number of file formats used in the leading 3D applications including <a class="text-primary" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodesk_3ds_Max" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3D Max</a> , <a class="text-primary" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blender_(software)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blender</a>, <a class="text-primary" href="https://www.cineversity.com/learn/Game-Development" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CINEMA</a>, <a class="text-primary" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodesk_Maya" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maya</a>, <a class="text-primary" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodesk_Softimage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Softimage</a> and many more. Furthermore, the game developers can have the access to use more than 15,000 free + paid 3D models, audio, animations, editor extensions, materials, scripts, and shaders while designing the games.

    <p>
    <h2 class="text-uppercase font-weight-bolder my-3">UNREAL Engine</h2>
    Unreal is the latest engine rolled out by one of the greatest American video games and software development companies Epic Games.
    <br><br>
    Unreal Engine 4 comes up with the incredible graphics, which gives a realistic gaming experience with features like advanced dynamic lightings. What makes this game engine even more miraculous is its new particle system that has the ability to handle as many as million particles in a single scene.
    <br><br>
    Additionally, Unreal Engine 4 uses the Blueprint Visual Scripting technology, which allows you create games using the Blueprint only. Even a non-programmer can write code and create games using the UE4 to an extent; however, such games would have some limits. Apart from all, the bad sight of this engine is, it is not able to develop games for the past generation consoles.

    <p>
    <h2 class="text-uppercase font-weight-bolder my-3">Cry Engine</h2>
    Cry Engine, first introduced by the great development corporation, Crytek, in the first Far Cry Game, is surely one of the most powerful and dominant game engines we have today.
    <br><br>
    Its graphical abilities outshine the Unity’s graphical capabilities and are equivalent to what Unreal holds. Though being a heavy and powerful game engine, Cry Engine takes a bit time to be able to use this platform effectively and a bit harder to grasp for the beginners. However, it has a dedicated Q&A forum called Cry Engine Answers, which clears all users’ doubts and queries, and helps users get the best experience.
    <br><br>
    Cry Engine supports <a class="text-primary"href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality" target="_blank_">Virtual Reality</a> and has astonishing visual effects including its volumetric fog and cloud rendering system, which gives the clouds a full 3D spatial rendering and a realistic visualization for fog and weather effects. Cry Engine also holds the capabilities of creating the high graphical games as well.
    <br><br>
    Moreover, it does not require its users to pay the royalty fee upon designing the game. However, you need to pay a fixed amount per month in order to gain the access to Cry Engine.
