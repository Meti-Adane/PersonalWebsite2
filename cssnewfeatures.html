                <date class="date-text">Mar 17 2020</date>
                <br>
                <div class="mt-4">
                    CSS3 is backwards-compatible with older versions of CSS meaning that CSS3 features also work on web pages using older CSS. It also has introduced new properties that debug previous quirks and extend CSS2 features, and it’s even got some JavaScript-like capabilities.
                        <br>
                        Unlike CSS1 which was mainly aimed at formatting just appearance CSS3 also addresses a number of mobile development concerns, accounting mainly for responsive design. In combination with JavaScript, CSS3 has a lot of the functionality of Flash now–animation- and interactivity-wise.
                        <br>
                        <h2 class="text-uppercase font-weight-bold my-3">1. Mobile-first mentality</h2>
                        
                        CSS3 inherently supports responsive design, and is equipped to handle media queries. Media queries are calls made by the code to determine what device and size screen a user is viewing the site on. This adds a whole new responsive design capability to the CSS repertoire.
                        <br>
                        <h2 class="text-uppercase font-weight-bold my-3">2. Module-based code</h2>
                        
                        Previously CSS2 consisted of a single specification that defined individual features. However CSS3 separates these specifications into convenient modules and introduces new features as well.
                        <br>
                        
                        
                        
                        New CSS3 modules include:<br>
                        <div class="indentedContent my-2">
                        <h2 class="font-weight-bold text-capitalize my-2">&#11044 Attribute Selectors</h2>
                        CSS2 introduced several attribute selectors. These allow for matching elements based on their attributes. CSS3 expands upon those attribute selectors. Instead of applying IDs or classes for styling, developers can select HTML elements according to their attributes. Selectors in CSS3 also allow substring selection. 
                        <br>
                        <h2 class="font-weight-bold text-capitalize my-2">&#11044 Insert Image</h2>
                        we can target almost any element on the page with a wide range of selectors.
                        <br>
                        <h2 class="font-weight-bold text-capitalize my-2">&#11044 The Box Model module</h2>
                         
                        This describes an approach to creating consistency between HTML elements on a page, or “boxes.” By applying margins, borders, and padding to a box’s content, developers can clear area around an element, give it borders, and more.
                        <br>
                        <h2 class="font-weight-bold text-capitalize my-2">&#11044 Box shadow</h2>
                        
                        A box shadow allows you to create a drop shadow for an element. Usually this effect is achieved using a repeated image around the element. However, with the property box-shadow this can be achieved by writing a single line of CSS code. After previously removing this property from the CSS 3 Backgrounds and Borders Module, the W3C added it back in the last working draft.
                        <br>
                        <h2 class="font-weight-bold text-capitalize my-2">&#11044 Border image</h2>
                        
                        Another exciting feature in CSS 3 is the ability to swap out a border with an image. The property border-image allows you to specify an image to display instead of a plain solid-colored border.
                        <br>
                        <h2 class="font-weight-bold text-capitalize my-2">&#11044 Rounded Corners</h2>
                        
                        The border-radius property lets you create rounded corners without the need for images or additional markup.Before the release of CSS3, developers had to write long code to produce rounded corners. Now, it is enough to apply the border-radius CSS3 property to HTML elements.
                        <br>
                        
                        <h2 class="font-weight-bold text-capitalize my-2">&#11044 Text effects</h2>
                        CSS3 includes shadow effects, text overflow (which hides text that gets too long for its element), word breaking (automatically breaking text so it fits within a box), and text wrapping–all things that save designers lots of formatting time.
                        <br>
                        <h2 class="font-weight-bold text-capitalize my-2">&#11044 Opacity</h2>
                        In addition to specifying transparency with HSLA and RGBA colors CSS3 provides the opacity property. Opacity sets the opaqueness of the element on which it’s declared, similar to alpha. <br>
                        While opacity sets the opacity value for an element and all of its children, a semitransparent RGBA or HSLA color has no impact on the element’s other CSS properties or descendants. The transparency level depends on the indicated values.<br>
                        </div>
                        <h2 class="text-uppercase font-weight-bold my-3">3. Web font support gives designers access to way more than just “web safe” fonts
                        </h2>
                        Instead of only using fonts labeled as web-safe, We can now apply more unique fonts in HTML documents. Before that, CSS wanted to ensure that all browsers and machines display fonts the same.
                        <br>
                        
                        Web safe fonts are fonts that every single computer has installed and recognizes. If a designer used common fonts like Times New Roman or Arial, they could pretty much guarantee that any user would view their site as it was intended. However, if they wanted to use a rarer font, if it wasn’t supported by a user’s machine, it would default back to a web safe font. Designers can now run web fonts in CSS3, special fonts.
                        <br>
                        <h2 class="text-uppercase font-weight-bold my-3">4. It enables faster development, and faster load times</h2>
                        What used to require background images, CSS3 can now achieve with visual enhancements, which saves developers time in production, Additionally CSS3 enables developers to produce fewer lines of codes these cut down on calls and load times for the website. Hence, pages load faster thanks to overall smaller file sizes and fewer calls.
                        <br>
                        <h2 class="text-uppercase font-weight-bold my-3">5. New colors and image effects</h2>
                        Prior to CSS3, we almost always declared colours using the hexadecimal format (#FFF, or #FFFFFF for white). It was also possible to declare colours using the rgb() notation, providing either integers (0–255) or percentages.
                        <br>
                        
                        The color keyword list has been extended in the CSS3 color module to include 147 additional keyword colors (that are generally well supported), CSS3 supports new colors (RGBA, HSL, HSLA) and gradient colors, and allows for adjustments to opacity. The most notable change with these new color types is the ability to declare semitransparent colors.<br>
                        <h2 class="text-uppercase font-weight-bold my-3">6. Box-sizing has fixed alignment problems</h2>
                        Box-sizing allows developers to get the sizing of elements right without having to subtract dimensions for padding and borders. With the box-sizing property, the padding and border are included in the height and width.
                        <br>
                        <h2 class="text-uppercase font-weight-bold my-3">7. Create 2D and 3D transformations, animations, and transitions</h2>
                        
                        These effects allow elements on a page to rotate, grow, shrink, flip, or translate into a different color. For the first time, elements created in CSS can move on screen without requiring any JavaScript or Flash code. With transitions, an element can seamlessly change size and color. You can set a duration for a transition, e.g. creating a button that slowly expands and changes color when you mouse over it.
